What's in a website? A cool link to put in a social media bio or on your resume?

This website exists as a way to document my journey as a musician, audio engineer, and fledgling developer. I'd also like to offer more creative insight on projects I'm working on, and maybe even post some educational content. Maybe I'll start writing about the philosophical concepts that implicate my every decision, personal and professional. Maybe I'll just post pictures of virtual race cars.

[I need a job.](https://youtu.be/5XcKBmdfpWs) Please hire me.
